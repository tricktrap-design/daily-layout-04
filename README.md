# Daily Layout No.04
*Web adaptation of a book cover*

[Click here to see the page](https://tricktrap.mx/labs/daily-layout-04/)

This is the fourth entry of Daily Layout, this time I tried to make a layout focused on vertical content.

In this particular example I was able to experiment with:

+ CSS Grid, minmax, fraction units
+ min-content and max-content
+ clamp() property for texts
+ No use of media queries

**Feel free to play around with it**

Don't forget to checkout my other repositories for more examples.

### Thank you!
